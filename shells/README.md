## List of Active Shells

- **`bash`** - located in `%ROOT%\Shells\bash`
- **`cmd`** - located in `%ROOT`plugins%\Shells\cmd`
- **`node`**- located in `%ROOT%\Shells\node`
- **`powershell`** - located in `%ROOT%\Shells\powershell`
- **`python`** - located in `%ROOT%\Shells\python`

## What these folders are for

Within the `Shells\SHELL-NAME` folders should be a few consistent folders:

1. **`logs`** - To keep logs of errors, warnings as well as general output.
2. **`plugins`** - To store any given plugin for a shell. Like `oh-my-bash` or `posh-git`.
3. **`profiles`** - To store preset profiles to load into the shell.

Any other folders that make sense on a per shell basis can also inhabit these folders.
