# Vendor Files 

> ***The Vendor directory is traditionally used for plugins or libraries that are not created by the user. Generally files and functions that the user is not responsible for maintaining themselves.***

## *Does not Maintain?*  What that means

Say all those libraries you download through your package manager. Those are maintained by someone else. You just download and use them.

### *This unfortunately is not what Cmder means when it creates a `vendor` directory*. 

It means a shit load of required files that do have to be maintained.
