# Cmder Installation

> *Quick guide on installing a portable version of cmder*

---

First Download a copy of Cmder mini.

- ▶ [Download Mini](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.24/cmder_mini.zip)

- [Download Full](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.24/cmder.zip)

> **Note on full download vs mini** 
>
> *The full version comes with git for windows built in. I’m going to take the mini version and add a copy of git myself.*

Move the downloaded zip to a location where it will stay and unzip it. 

I’m going to install it on my USB stick and also in Dropbox.

```bash
# USB Cmder Path
"D:\Repo\Settings\OS\Windows\Apps\Active\Cmder"

# Dropbox File
"~\Dropbox\Repo\Settings\OS\Windows\Apps\Active\Cmder"
```
