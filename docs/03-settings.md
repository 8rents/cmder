## Settings panel

Here I'll be going through the settings panel one pane at a time and setting everything up.

## Backing up your settings

Make sure to export a copy of your settings. I like to: 

1. export one to `Cmder\Settings.xml`
2. and another one to `Cmder\vendor\conemu-maximus5\ConEmu.xml`

It would be great if we could just load `Cmder\Settings.xml` as our settings file and be done with it. **I'll figure out a better way soon.**
